Meteor MQTT Client
==================

[Meteor](http://www.meteor.com) [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) client using [mqtt package from NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/package/mqtt).

So far, only subscribing to messages is possible, no publishing (because my underlying use case doesn't need publishing).
But I'll add the publish feature later.
